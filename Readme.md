Clothing Brand E-Commerce Website
This project is the development of a full-fledged e-commerce website for a clothing brand, inspired by popular Pakistani clothing brand Bonanza Satrangi. The website will offer a seamless online shopping experience for users, allowing them to browse a wide variety of clothing products, view detailed information, and easily make purchases.

Key Features:
User Authentication: Secure login and signup system allowing customers to create and manage their accounts. Users will also be able to view their order history and save favorite items.

Product Catalog: A comprehensive catalog of clothing items with categories like Men, Women, and Kids, each showcasing a variety of fabrics, ready-to-wear items, and accessories.

Product Filtering: Users can filter products based on categories, price range, size, and color to make shopping easier.

Product Detail Pages: Each product will have a detailed page with images, descriptions, price, and size options. Customers can view zoomed-in images and select product variations (size, color, etc.).

Shopping Cart: Users can add items to their cart, modify quantities, and view the total price of their cart in real-time. The shopping cart will provide a user-friendly interface for a smooth shopping experience.

Checkout Process: A streamlined checkout page that collects shipping information, displays order summaries, and integrates payment systems like Stripe or PayPal for secure transactions.

Admin Panel (Optional): A simple admin dashboard where the brand's team can manage products, view orders, and handle user management.

Responsive Design: The website will be fully responsive, offering an optimal shopping experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: EJS for server-side rendering, Bootstrap for styling, and custom CSS.
Backend: Node.js and Express.js for handling server logic and routing.
Database: MongoDB for storing user, product, and order data.
Payment Integration: Stripe or PayPal for payment processing.
Deployment: The website will be deployed using services like Render or Heroku for the backend, and Netlify for the frontend.
